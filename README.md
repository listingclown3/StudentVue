About:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a TypeScript Project using EGGaming's Typescript version of the StudentVue API.

EGGaming Typescript API: https://github.com/EGGaming/studentvue.js

Original JS StudentVue API: https://github.com/StudentVue/StudentVue.js

There is a compiled version of the TypeScript project in the files as a .cjs file. For some reason when I tried to build the TypeScript file it said there was an await error but then when I ran the JS file that it generated anyways as a .CJS file it worked... so yeah I guess it works or something.


How to build (SpoonFeeding Edition cause I had no prior knowledge on TS or JS so this is for the nubs, if you're here on GitHub at least know what an IDE is...):
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Open your IDE and like have this project open or something

Edit whatever you want or keep it idk

Go to your terminal and type: "tsc index.ts" to build the TypeScript file.

Then it'll generate an "index.js" file

Now for me, for some reason it runs when you change the file format to .cjs, so change the file format to "index.cjs"

Then run "node index.cjs"

It SHOULD display the code you requested in like 2 - 3 seconds depending on how fast things go.

Other things:

Refer to EGGaming's TypeScript API to change the output of things, like the student information. At the time I am writing this I didn't even explore the entire thing which is probably a bad thing. Also, please like make this to the top of the StudentVue API page thing so people know this exists. The other projects are a little outdated but it might just be me and my horrendous knowledge of programming, or both.

Join Discord for help and other things. I'll be making a Discord Bot that prints this information for "easier" access. It will display information via DM's for information privacy purposes. I might implement a "Remember Me" feature to allow access to your own StudentVue account via your Discord account. I plan to do this soon, so join the Discord server and maybe help out on development with the bot!
